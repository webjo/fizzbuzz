#Exercise: Write a simple fizz-buzz REST server.
 
The original fizz-buzz consists in writing all numbers from 1 to 100, and just replacing all multiples of 3 by “fizz”, all multiples of 5 by “buzz”, and all multiples of 15 by “fizzbuzz”. The output would look like this:
“1,2,fizz,4,buzz,fizz,7,8,fizz,buzz,11,fizz,13,14,fizzbuzz,fizz,...”
 
##More specifically :
Expose a REST API endpoint that accepts five parameters : two strings (say, string1 and string2), and three integers (say, int1, int2 and limit), and returns a JSON
It must return a list of strings with numbers from 1 to limit, where:
- all multiples of int1 are replaced by string1,
- all multiples of int2 are replaced by string2,
- all multiples of int1 and int2 are replaced by string1string2
- There is no constraint on the chosen language (but Go would be appreciated)
